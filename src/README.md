CUSTOMER KATA

Mango is creating a new shop online and in order to get as much people enrolled as possible, every new registered user will have access to new promotions, but they must deserve it, so they have to participate on a contest sharing the best slogans they can imagine in order to get the prize. The first iteration consist on creating REST endpoints to enable the following features:

1. Given a customer wants to get his/her deserved promotions they need to sign into mango.com.
   Just to give a clue on the data that need to be returned the front-end form would look as follows:

In order to get customer trust we want to give as much transparency as possible logged customers can query its own details, to figure out what details mango owns related to them.

2. Everybody can do mistakes so we want to give flexibility to customers logged customers can modify all its details, (ie. mail).

3. A user can share slogans with
   Mango following these rules:

Maximum of 3 slogans by registered customer

TIPS:
As you will see this feature is not covering all user journey, you don't need to implement the login.
All the UI mocks are just to give you a reference about the request/response content, you donâ€™t need to implement any sort of UI
